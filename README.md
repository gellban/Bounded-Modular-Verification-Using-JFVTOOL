# Bounded-Modular-Verification-Using-JFVTOOL
JFVTool is a bounded modular verification tool that formally checks whether or not the programâ€™s methods have been implemented according to their specifications. This tool automatically checks the code for all possible cases (within some bounds), and verifies that it meets the specifications.
